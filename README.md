## Installation

### Setup
You will need Node.js (v6.10.1+) to build and run the server [Get Node](https://nodejs.org/).  
You will need Node Package Manager (v4.4.4+) to install this project (installs with Node.js by default):  
After installing Node.js, open your favorite terminal:
```bash
$ node -v
v6.10.1
$ npm -v
4.4.4
```
If you do not get npm 4.4.4+, download it from: [npm v4.4.4](https://registry.npmjs.org/npm/-/npm-4.4.4.tgz) and extract it to the `node_modules` folder of your node.js installation directory.

You are now ready to begin installing the program!

  ```bash
  $ cd Desired-Path-Here
